# Parameters to include:
# - Games per bot,
# - mutation vs crossover percent
# - fast bot count
# - bots per simulation
# - generations
# - Mutation restrictions:
#   - only mutate constant input nodes (boolean)
#   - Percent chance of mutating an operator
#   - Max children that an operator you are mutating is allowed to have
# - Selection Percent after each generation
# - Threshold for a bot to be a candidate for mutation
# - Threshold for a bot to be a candidate for cross-over



# Other things to do: constants can only be the child of a multiplication operation
# Cannot have both children of an operator be constants
